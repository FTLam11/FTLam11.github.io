      <p>This post seeks to depict how the tech industry currently impacts music from a DIY perspective. IMHO, it's a pretty good time for DIY music. Topics for this discussion include (not going to discuss how fair each of these are to artists, that is outside the scope of this post):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Video streaming services</li>
        <li>eCommerce platforms</li>
        <li>Music streaming services</li>
        <li>Cross platform support</li>
        <li>Social networking</li>
        <li>The path forward</li>
      </ul>
      <h1>Video streaming services</h1>
      <p>Whoa, why am I starting with video streaming services? Today's game is way different than yesterday's game. Youtube has become a huge platform not just for big television networks, news, gaming, but music as well. You will find music videos, live shows, band interviews, documentaries, bootlegs, individual songs, and even entire albums on Youtube now. Here's a short list of benefits Youtube brings:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Youtube channels</li>
        <li>Fully customizable playlists by genre, band, label, and anything else you could think of</li>
        <li>Easy access to media you do not own</li>
        <li>No waiting for complete download, just stream it</li>
        <li>Timestamping for individual songs</li>
        <li>Related videos to further feed your need</li>
        <li>Data analysis to better understand your audience and potential paths forward</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As much as I enjoy to rock my old man pants and tell whippersnappers to get off my lawn, digital music has been a thing for a long time now. New generations of kids growing up now are listening to their tunes on digital platforms like Youtube than from a physical product. You got a device that can connect to the Internet? Hop on Youtube and go listen to some tunes.</p>
      <h1>eCommerce platforms</h1>
      <p>Say you have some merchandise. Tape, CD, vinyl, stickers, pins, clothing, etc... You can now open your own store online for free (with limitations) using services like <a href = "http://www.storenvy.com/">Storenvy</a>, <a href = "https://www.bigcartel.com/">Big Cartel</a>, and <a href = "https://bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a>. You can then accept different payment methods, prepare shipments, automate notifications, and take advantage of other general eCommerce features to sell your merch.</p>
      <h1>Music streaming services</h1>
      <p>I'll admit I'm not a big fan of music streaming services like Spotify and Pandora. Last.fm and Soundcloud are pretty cool though, but I don't use the streaming features. However, tons of people like to stream their music since they don't have the actual files or physical product. It's ease of use and convenience. People want their tunes on-demand and mostly ad-free too!</p>
      <h1>Cross platform support</h1>
      <p>Got a modern device? It's probably got support for music services and can connect to the Internet. And as we get more and more devices with more and more software, that thing about the Internet of Things... yeah.</p>
      <h1>Social networking</h1>
      <p>I really don't need to address this feature. You already know about Facebook, Twitter, tumblr, Instagram, Vine, etc... but it will lead to the last point below.</p>
      <h1>The path forward</h1>
      <p>So with all these different tools and services at our disposal, what is missing, or what could be done differently? Here I will demonstrate my ignorance as well as share some ideas and questions below. If you have some ideas, please share!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Archiving: Find a solution that integrates media like images, video, and audio with text to accurately document and dynamically portray different scenes throughout music history. It would be really cool to see all these things on a timeline, have all the data crowdsourced like Wikis, and include discussion/annotation features like Genius and Reddit.</li>
        <li>Live streaming of shows: Would a model following in the footsteps of Twitch make sense? I've seen live streaming of shows done on Youtube, but only for big well-known artists.</li>
        <li>What are the biggest tech issues facing artists now?</li>
        <li>How should revenue sharing be changed between artists and services like Youtube, Spotify, etc...</li>
        <li>When and how will social networking platforms change to accomadate specialized interests?</li>
      </ul>
