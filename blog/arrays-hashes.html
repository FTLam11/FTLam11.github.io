    <h1>Arrays and Hashes: Shit From An Old Notebook</h1>

      <p>Enter Phase 0 Week 4 of Dev Bootcamp. This post addresses two Ruby collections: arrays and hashes.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What is an array?</li>
        <li>What is a hash?</li>
        <li>Which should I use?</li>
      </ul>
      <h1>What is an array?</h1>
      <p>An array is a collection of data arranged by index. Typically we use arrays to collect numbers or strings, and we can reference specific elements by the index.</p>
      <div class = "code center"><pre><code>>> my_array = ["D Boon", "Mike Watt", "George Hurley", 3]
=> ["D Boon", "Mike Watt", "George Hurley", 3]
>> my_array[0]
=> "D Boon"
>> my_array[1..2]
=> ["Mike Watt", "George Hurley"]</code></pre></div>
      <h1>What is a hash?</h1>
      <p>A hash is a collection of data arranged in key/value pairs. Similar to how arrays can be referenced by index, hashes can be referenced by key. In this way, each key in a hash must be unique, i.e., there can be no duplicate keys in a given hash. In contrast to arrays, hash keys are interesting in that they don't have to be a number, a key can also be a string or symbol. Symbols in particular are often used for hashes for a few reasons: symbols cannot be changed once they are created, only one copy of any symbol can exist at a time, and symbols have better performance than strings-as-keys.</p>
      <div class = "code center"><pre><code>>> my_hash = {guitar: "D Boon", bass: "Mike Watt", drums: "George Hurley"}
=> {:guitar=>"D Boon", :bass=>"Mike Watt", :drums=>"George Hurley"}
>> my_hash[:guitar]
=> "D Boon"
>> my_hash.each {|instrument, name| puts "#{name} plays #{instrument} for Minutemen."}
D Boon plays guitar for Minutemen.
Mike Watt plays bass for Minutemen.
George Hurley plays drums for Minutemen.
</code></pre></div>
      <h1>Which should I use?</h1>
      <p>When deciding between which collection to use, consider these points:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Does my data make use of labels? In the above code blocks, a hash would be more suited since we can associate instruments with members and vice verssa. We are limited to one or the other when using a single array.</li>
        <li>Does my data behave as a stack or queue? Arrays would be more suitable since there are methods like push and pop.</li>
        <li>Does my data need to be ordered? Though hashes are now ordered by their insertion order, arrays are typically used for ordered data with available methods like sort.</li>
      </ul>
