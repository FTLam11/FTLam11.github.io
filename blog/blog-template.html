<!-- 
How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

- With a blog post being a relatively simple object to wireframe, it was pretty easy and smooth. We first brainstormed different elements and content that a typical blog post should have. Once we had a list of those ideas, we set out to arrange each object in Balsamiq and Mockingbird. We were able to come to consensus about where and what order to place each object.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

- Yes, it gave us a visual cue to use once we started translating the wireframe to HTML. Even with only a few objects to wireframe, it was pretty beneficial and would be even more helpful for complex websites.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

- We both agreed that a good wireframe should demonstrate a few characteristics: easy to navigate, logical layout, and be easy to modify in the future.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

- We strictly used the HTML elements learned from previous modules.
