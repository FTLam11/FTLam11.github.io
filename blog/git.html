      <p>Enter Phase 0 Week 1 of Dev Bootcamp. This post addresses several matters related to Git and GitHub.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Observations regarding version control and its benefits</li>
        <li>Tracking changes</li>
        <li>The utility of GitHub</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Version control is essential to the overall development lifecycle. By utilizing version control, teams of developers can concurrently work on a project in a structured and logical manner. Changes to any repository files can be viewed, approved, reverted, and more. Developers can be notified of changes to ensure they are working on up-to-date code, preventing rework and confusion from files in question.</p>
      <p>Git provides several features for tracking changes. Using a commit log and messages, developers can easily trace changes as well as view modifications. Commit times and specific changes are conveniently available. Separate histories are also kept for each branch, allowing developers to concurrently work on different features before discussing what to include to the master branch.</p>
      <p>GitHub provides data redundancy, developer networking, collaborative tool, and open source repository. Having options to save data to more than one place is very important in this age, since data becomes more and more valuable. Being a giant open source repository, developers can use GitHub to share ideas and improve upon existing code. Finally, developers can use GitHub as a professional networking tool to display their work and skills.</p>
