      <p>Enter Phase 0 Week 9 of Dev Bootcamp. Phase 1 is nearly here, and I'll spend some final momements reflecting on building this site as well as what to look forward to throughout the rest of DBC.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Overall impressions of site building</li>
        <li>The path forward</li>
      </ul>
      <h1>Overall impressions of site building</h1>
      <p>Building a personal website has been pretty fun overall. The thing I liked most about building the site was designing it, specifically the brainstorming process and laying out the structure and content. The most challenging tasks were making the site responsive and manipulating CSS to make the site actually reflect the design. With so many different devices accessing websites at different screen sizes and orientations, it is quite the challenge to ensure the website's appearance looks consistent across all platforms. I found I had to compromise some of my initial design, since there was such a drastic difference for the landing page on mobile and tablet compared to a desktop. In terms of developing, I think having a complete list of good requirements is essential to the entire development process. However, depending on the project and other constraints, this might not be necessary when using developing in spirals.</p>
      <h1>The path forward</h1>
      <p>I plan to continue writing on this blog. Doing this will definitely help reinforce what I'm learning while also making knowledge available to any readers. I think I'll make a weekly post, but posts may be more frequent depending on how much information I'm digesting during any given day or week. The next nine weeks are going be fun and exhausting. Good luck to the Fiery Skippers of 2016!</p>
