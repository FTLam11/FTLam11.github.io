      <p>Enter Phase 0 Week 8 of Dev Bootcamp. This post gives a high level overview of bubble sort.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Quick explanation of bubble sort</li>

      <h1>Quick explanation of bubble sort</h1>
      <p>For this week's DBC blog post, we were given a bunch of potential topics to write about. Sorting algorithms was one of the topics I had interest in, so here is a post about bubble sort. After spending some time skimming over some of the most well-known sorting algorithms, I felt bubble sort was the easiest to explain and write about. Using an array of unsorted numbers as an example, bubble sort compares two adjacent elements and puts them in ascending order. This comparison is repeated until no swaps are made, indicating the array is already sorted since no further swapping of elements is required.</p>
      <p>I'm still not an expert at describing the performance of algorithms, so I won't mention explicit metrics. The best and worst case scenarios were the easiest ways for me to characterize bubble sort's performance. An example of the best case scenario would be an object that is already sorted, since no swaps will be made and bubble sort can be performed in one pass. An example of the worst case scenario would be an object that is sorted in reverse order, since the most swaps will occur. I'll use three examples below to better explain these scenarios.</p>
      <h1>Ruby implementation and examples</h1>
      <div class = "code center"><pre><code># Initial
# def bubble_sort(arr)
#   p arr
#   loop do
#     swap = false
#     for i in 1..arr.length-1
#       if arr[i-1] > arr[i]
#         temp = arr[i]
#         arr[i] = arr[i-1]
#         arr[i-1] = temp
#         swap = true
#         p arr
#       end
#     end
#     break if swap == false
#   end
#   arr
# end

# Refactored
def bubble_sort(arr)
  p arr
  loop do
    swap = false
    for i in 1..arr.length-1
      if arr[i-1] > arr[i]
        arr[i],arr[i-1] = arr[i-1],arr[i]
        swap = true
        p arr
      end
    end
    break if swap == false
  end
end

# Driver code
# unsorted generic case
bubble_sort([5,1,4,2,8])
# output
[5, 1, 4, 2, 8]
[1, 5, 4, 2, 8]
[1, 4, 5, 2, 8]
[1, 4, 2, 5, 8]
[1, 2, 4, 5, 8]

# reverse sorted worst case
bubble_sort([5,4,3,2,1])
# output
[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
[4, 5, 3, 2, 1]
[4, 3, 5, 2, 1]
[4, 3, 2, 5, 1]
[4, 3, 2, 1, 5]
[3, 4, 2, 1, 5]
[3, 2, 4, 1, 5]
[3, 2, 1, 4, 5]
[2, 3, 1, 4, 5]
[2, 1, 3, 4, 5]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# sorted best case
bubble_sort([3,3,3,3,3])
# output
[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
</code></pre></div>
      <h1>Observations</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Walking through the unsorted generic case, the first pass will have two swaps: (5,4) and (5,2). The second pass will have one swap (4,2). The third pass has no swaps, and hence the array is sorted.</li>
        <li>By looking at the output from the reverse sorted worst case, we can see there are many more swaps required when using bubble sort. Even though the first example and this example both have five elements, the number of swaps necessary greatly increases in the second example.</li>
        <li>Finally, the sorted best case has only one pass required, since no swaps are necessary.</li>
