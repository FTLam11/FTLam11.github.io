    <h1>Professional Experience</h1>
    <p>In 2011, I started my career through a Department of Homeland Security initiative called the Acquisition Professional Career Program as an 0801 Systems Engineer. Working with Customs and Border Protection and United States Coast Guard, I provided Systems Engineering and Project Management support to acquire surveillance systems and boats. After gaining valuable experience in Test & Evaluation, Configuration Management, Deployment, and Requirements & Architecture, I wanted to work abroad to have both private industry and overseas experience.</p>
    <p>Moving abroad to Taipei, Taiwan I landed an opportunity with Synology Inc., a network attached storage (NAS) company. Working as a Technical Writer I authored help documentation for DiskStation Manager 5.0 and 5.1 (browser-based operating system for Synology NAS devices) and lead a front-end/back-end upgrade for Synology Help. Gaining exposure to IT areas of networks, cyber security, mobile media, surveillance, and cloud storage, I wanted to get involved in the technical side of web development. This lead me to enroll in Dev Bootcamp, an immersive web development program.</p>
    <h1>Education</h1>
    <p>In 2010, I graduated from the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign with a B.S. in General Engineering and minors in East Asian Languages and Cultures and International Engineering. During my time in college, I also studied abroad in the summer of 2008 in Beijing at Tsinghua University and spring of 2010 in Taipei at National Taiwan University. After working for four years with the Department of Homeland Security and Synology Inc., I decided to switch career paths and am currently enrolled with Dev Bootcamp. I graduate in June 2016 as a member of the Fiery Skippers cohort.</p>
    <h1>Personal Q&A</h1>
    <h2 class = "qa">Where are you from?</h2>
    <p>Hard question! I'm originally from Chicago but grew up in Skokie, Illinois and have spent considerable time living/working in DCMDVA and Taipei. I like Chicago deep dish pizza and hotdogs, Virginia kabobs, and Taiwanese drinks and breakfast!</p>
    <h2 class = "qa">What do you do for fun?</h2>
    <p>I enjoy basketball, live music, biking, jamming, gaming, and public transportation. I also operate <a href = "http://nuocnam.myds.me/~nuocnamrecords/">Nuoc Nam Records</a> for fun.</p>
    <h2 class = "qa">Keeping with Dev Bootcamp tradition, what is something quirky about you?</h2>
    <p>I am the grapefruit/pomelo master. Grapefruit is a top-tier citrus fruit. It takes time to peel a grapefruit, but the sweet n' sour taste is too good. Grapefruit is tasty by itself, and goes really well with tea. Nothing like a grapefruit green tea (or three) in 100 degree 100% humidity weather.</p>
