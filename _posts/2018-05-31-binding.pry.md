I have a sudden realization I want to share. Today we inspect
`binding.pry`.

Besides being a great debugger and tool for writing code, this method
call is actually aptly named. Looking at the etymology, **binding**
alone didn't have the necessary context to have any significant meaning
to me. Wasn't until after I saw this word used in the blocks chapter of
Metaprogramming Ruby did I realize how it was being used.

"Code that runs is actually made up of two things: the code itself and a
set of bindings." Okay, I see you **binding**, a.k.a the connection
between a name and an object.

To **pry** into something is to go overboard into investigating
something. Ruby is a language that features objects and the ability to introspect the fuck
out of them. Hence, `binding.pry` is clever all many levels. Well
played!
