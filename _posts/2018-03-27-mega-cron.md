Lord have mercy on my soul. I wasted 2 hours inspecting file
permissions, API documentation, and looking through log files trying to
find out what was wrong with my file caching. Turns out my crontab was
running the caching task at the 3rd minute of each hour instead of every
3 minutes. Sigh.

Find a pretty cool utility though: [cronguru](https://crontab.guru/)

RIGHT

```
*/3 * * * * cd /home/app && RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake cache:write && chown -R app:app tmp
```
WRONG

```
3 * * * * cd /home/app && RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake cache:write && chown -R app:app tmp
```
