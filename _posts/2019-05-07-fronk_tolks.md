Wooooooooo been giving tolks every few weeks at work. Definitely feels
good to have some time during work to share knowledge and have
open-ended discussions. Here are some things I shared recently:

[Non-technical intro to Software
Testing](https://github.com/FTLam11/fronk-tolks/blob/master/we-talkin-bout-testing.md)

[A strange deep dive into Ruby classes via
tests](https://github.com/FTLam11/fronk-tolks/tree/master/spec)

[Vue workshop: Making
Tic-tac-toe](https://github.com/FTLam11/fronk-tolks/blob/master/vue-workshop.md)

Thinking of doing a twofer for the next talk, combining Rails Engines
and a more technical-oriented talk on software testing.
