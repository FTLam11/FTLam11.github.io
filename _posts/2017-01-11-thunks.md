Watched some videos giving an overview of asynchronous JavaScript, all taught by Kyle Simpson. What's a thunk?

**"Time is the most complex factor of state in your program."**

A thunk is simply a function that uses closure to keep track of some value(s) and returns them when the thunk is called.

The code snippet below is a synchronous thunk. It feeds arguments to babyRage() and returns it. Every single time we call thunk(), it will give reasons for what causes rage.

{% highlight javascript %}
function babyRage(x, y) {
  return x + ' and ' + y;
};

var thunk = function() {
  return babyRage("I have a jungle LC", "and no support");
};

thunk(); // "I have a jungle LC and and no support"
{% endhighlight %}

Next is an asynchronous thunk. This thunk takes a callback, give a couple reasons for rage, and hands babyRageAsync() the callback. Same output as our first thunk.

{% highlight javascript %}
function babyRageAsync(x, y, cb) {
  setTimeout(function() {
    var reasons = x + ' and ' + y;
    cb(reasons);
  }, 1000);
};

var thunk = function(cb) {
  babyRageAsync("I have a jungle LC", "and no support", cb);
}

thunk(function(rage) {
  console.log(rage); // "I have a jungle LC and and no support"
});
{% endhighlight %}

What is the significance? TO BE CONTINUED!
