Sometimes I thought **that** was `this`, but `this` turned out to be *something else entirely*. I learned `this` is not assigned a value until its containing function is invoked. **Whatever object invokes the function** containing `this` becomes `this`.

In the global scope, `this` refers to the **window** object. However, when strict mode is enabled,  `this` is assigned `undefined` in global functions and in anonymous functions not bound to an object.

{% highlight javascript %}
var subject = 'Yo mama';
var joke = 'got the wooden leg with real feet';

function makeJoke() {
  console.log(this.subject + ' ' + this.joke);
};

var obj = {
  subject: 'Yo mama',
  joke: 'got an afro with a chin strap',
  makeJoke: function() {
    console.log(this.subject + ' ' + this.joke);
  }
} ;

makeJoke(); // Yo mama got the wooden leg with real feet
window.makeJoke(); // same thing as above since makeJoke() is defined globally and window is the invoker
obj.makeJoke(); // Yo mama got an afro with a chin strap
{% endhighlight %}

In the example, `makeJoke()` and `window.makeJoke()` are equivalent. **window** is the invoker, so `this` is assigned to **window**. `obj.makeJoke()` on the other hand has **obj** as the invoker, so `this` is assigned to **obj**. Next time, I'll take a look at common cases where `this` is misunderstood and pulls some trick-tronkory.
