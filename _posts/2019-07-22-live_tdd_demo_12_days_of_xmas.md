title:  Live TDD Demo - 12 Days of Xmas
date:   2019-07-22
tags: [ruby, testing, mob programming]

I gave a follow-up talk on unit testing a couple weeks ago, it was really
fun because it was my first time participating in mob programming. There
were about twenty participants with really diverse backgrounds and
programming language experiences. The goal was to output the lyrics for
Twelve Days of Christmas by using TDD.

We made a lot of decisions, some by committee and some by praying to the
RNG gods. The solution we came to as a group can be seen
[here](https://github.com/FTLam11/fronk-tolks/blob/feat/ftl-live-testing-demo/spec/06_twelve_days_spec.rb).
Unfortunately we did not have time for a critical step in TDD:
**refactoring**. I'll see if I can bring it up for a future talk.
