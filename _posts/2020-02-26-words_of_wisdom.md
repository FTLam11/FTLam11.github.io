About time for the yearly re-reading of [POODR](https://www.poodr.com/).
Cherry-picking some nuggets here and there:

>  The purpose of design is to allow you to do design later and its
>  primary goal is to reduce the cost of change.

>  A tool cannot be faulted for its use, the user must master the tool.

>  This "improve it now" versus "improve it later" tension always
>  exists. Applications are never perfectly designed. Every choice has a
>  price. A good designer understands this tension and minimizes costs
>  by making informed tradeoffs between the needs of the present and the
>  possibilities of the future.

>  The road to maintenance nirvana is paved with classes that depend on
>  things that change less often than they do.

>  It’s not what an object is that matters, it’s what it does.
