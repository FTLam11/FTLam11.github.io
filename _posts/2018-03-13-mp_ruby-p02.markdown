Noting highlights from the book Metaprogramming Ruby (2nd Edition).

# Chapter 2. Monday: The Object Model

* "For class, the core job is to move you in the context of the class, where you can define methods."
* **Open Class Method**: can always reopen an existing class and modify them on the fly

{% highlight ruby %}
String.instance_methods.grep /^z/
=> []

class String
  def zang!
    upcase!
  end
end

String.instance_methods.grep /^z/
=> [:zang!]

'zang'.zang!
=> "ZANG"
{% endhighlight %}

* **Monkeypatch**: Abusing Open Class method in a harmful way, e.g.,
overwriting existing methods of the same name and cause a previously
reliable and stable method to break
* The superclass of a class is Module - a class is simply a Module with
3 additional instance methods: new, allocate, superclass
