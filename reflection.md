####1. What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

> I learned the importance of having good HTML structure, since this directly influenced how I could approach the CSS. The biggest restructuring of my HTML was adding a div wrapper to contain the body of my technical blog. Chrome Devtools was instrumental in allowing me to play around with padding, borders, and margin. For the most part, I only used borders temporarily to visualize each element. Padding was used to make text display fully while margin was used to create white space and for centering my text columns.

####2. What did you learn about CSS positioning?

> The biggest thing I was able to grasp before getting good command of CSS positioning is the "normal flow" concept. Once I understood inline vs block display, I was able to more easily manipulate positioning of each HTML element. Combining the display propery with positioning allowed me to create a grid-like system for my blog roll.

####3. What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

> Overall, my design is really simple since it's all static information. The structuring was the easiest since there wasn't much information, and was tweaked on-the-go once I started styling. The most difficult aspect was actually positioning each element. I still have to incorporate responsive design into my websit.

####4. What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

> Using Chrom Devtools made adding and formatting elements seamless. I was able to experiment with Chrome Devtools, and then easily copy my chosen CSS declarations into my stylesheet. The usage of both IDs and classes was also instrumental in allowing me to group elements together and format them easily.
